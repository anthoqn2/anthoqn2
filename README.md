### **Hey There! I'm Anthony Nguyen, a first year at UC Irvine pursuing a Computer Science B.S.**  
I decided to pursue Computer Science because nothing beats the satisfaction of completing a programming project   
and seeing a tangible product run after multiple debugging session. 
Projects never feel unfinished and there are always way to improve my projects thus making it refreshing to look at my previous projects to see how far I've come.
