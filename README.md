### **Hey There! I'm Anthony Nguyen - a Software Analyst at Deloitte Consulting**  
I pursued Computer Science because few things compare to the satisfaction of bringing a programming project to life â€” watching it finally run after countless debugging sessions.
What I love most about software development is that no project ever truly feels complete; there are always new ways to refine, optimize, and improve. Itâ€™s rewarding to look back at my earlier work and see how much Iâ€™ve grown along the way.

After graduating from UCI, I was fortunate to find a role at Deloitte Consulting where I get to do what I love every day â€” solving problems, building solutions, and continually learning.
