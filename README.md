### **Hey There! I'm Anthony Nguyen, a fourth year student at UC Irvine pursuing a Computer Science B.S.**  
I decided to pursue Computer Science because nothing could surpass the satisfaction of completing a programming project 
and seeing a tangible product run after multiple debugging session. 
Projects never feel unfinished and there are always way to improve my projects thus making it refreshing to look at my previous projects to see how far I've come.
